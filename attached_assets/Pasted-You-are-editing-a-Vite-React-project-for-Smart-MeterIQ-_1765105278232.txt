You are editing a Vite + React project for "Smart MeterIQ UI".

Goal:
Fix all "Failed to fetch" errors on the Energy Loss & Health page by pointing the frontend to the correct backend base URL and using it consistently.

Backend API base URL (DO NOT CHANGE):
https://73f0d221-7b02-428e-a6ec-1d9bebd857bb-00-2dbtzbmvqtyw.kirk.replit.dev

Do the following steps EXACTLY:

1) Update src/apiConfig.js

- Open the file:
  src/apiConfig.js

- Replace its entire contents with EXACTLY this:

  ```js
  // src/apiConfig.js
  // Single source of truth for the backend API URL used by Smart MeterIQ UI.

  export const API_BASE =
    'https://73f0d221-7b02-428e-a6ec-1d9bebd857bb-00-2dbtzbmvqtyw.kirk.replit.dev';
Save the file.

Fix imports and fetch calls in EnergyLossHealthPage.jsx

Open the file:
src/pages/EnergyLossHealthPage.jsx

At the top of the file, ensure there is ONLY ONE React import and ONE apiConfig import, exactly like this:

js
Copy code
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { API_BASE } from '../apiConfig';
If there is a duplicate import React ... line, DELETE the duplicate so only the snippet above remains.

Now, in this same file, find ALL fetch( calls and make sure they use API_BASE and the correct paths.

Update them to match EXACTLY the following four patterns (create them if needed, or edit existing ones):

js
Copy code
// Overview KPIs
fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/kpi/energy-loss/overview`)

// Feeders / zones loss view
fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/kpi/energy-loss/feeders`)

// Suspicious meters
fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/kpi/energy-loss/suspicious-meters`)

// FieldOps summary
fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/kpi/energy-loss/fieldops`)
VERY IMPORTANT:

Remove any hard-coded URLs like:

http://localhost:3001/...

http://127.0.0.1:3001/...

any other base URL.

After you finish, the ONLY base used in this file for these four endpoints must be ${API_BASE} as shown above.

Do NOT change any other logic, JSX, or component names in this file. Only fix:

duplicate imports,

and the fetch URLs to use API_BASE.

(Optional note for the user – do NOT run commands yourself)

When you are done editing files, tell me:
"Edits applied. You can now run: npm run dev from the smart-meteriq-ui folder."
Do NOT run the commands yourself; just confirm that the edits were made cleanly and there are no syntax errors left in EnergyLossHealthPage.jsx.

Copy code

After the AI does that and confirms:

1. In PowerShell:

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\cdean\OneDrive\Desktop\Smart MeterIQ\smart-meteriq-ui'
npm run dev
Open the Energy Loss & Health page and see if the data loads.

If it still errors after this script, copy the new error message from DevTools → Network (status code + message) and send it to me.
