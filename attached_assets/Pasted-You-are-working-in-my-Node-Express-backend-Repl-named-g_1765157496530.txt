You are working in my Node/Express backend Repl named “gridlens-api”.

GOAL
-----
Fix the JSON returned by the Energy Loss & Health (Electric) API so the frontend
does NOT show:

- Total Meters: 12,000
- Healthy Meters: 0
- Problem Meters: 12,000
- System Health %: 0.0%

Instead, I want realistic values like:

- Total Meters: 12,000
- Healthy Meters: 11,250
- Problem Meters: 750
- System Health %: 93.8%

The React frontend already works and is calling this backend at:
  /api/kpi/energy-loss/overview
  /api/kpi/energy-loss/feeders
  /api/kpi/energy-loss/suspicious-meters
  /api/kpi/energy-loss/fieldops

Do NOT change the routes or the URL paths. Only fix the mock data.

WHAT TO DO (step-by-step)
-------------------------
1. Open the main server file (likely `index.js`).
   - Find the Express handler that serves GET `/api/kpi/energy-loss/overview`.

2. Print the CURRENT response object for that route so you can see what it returns.

3. Replace ONLY the hard-coded mock values with these new ones:

   ```js
   const overview = {
     totalMeters: 12000,
     healthyMeters: 11250,
     problemMeters: 750,
     systemHealthPercent: 93.8,
     percentHealthyByZone: [
       { zone: 'Zone 1', percentHealthy: 92 },
       { zone: 'Zone 2', percentHealthy: 94 },
       { zone: 'Zone 3', percentHealthy: 95 }
     ]
   };
Make sure the handler returns this object as JSON, for example:
res.json(overview);

Next, find the handler for GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/feeders.

Make sure each feeder object uses these property names so the React table
shows data in ALL columns:

js
Copy code
{
  name: 'Feeder 101',
  zone: 'Zone 1',
  loss_percent: 4.2,
  loss_kwh: 12500,
  loss_dollars: 18750,
  active_work_orders: 2
}
Return an array of 4–5 realistic feeders using EXACTLY these keys:

name

zone

loss_percent

loss_kwh

loss_dollars

active_work_orders

Do NOT change any other routes or the CORS setup.

After editing, restart the server and SELF-TEST:

Call each endpoint from inside the Repl (or using the built-in HTTP tester):

GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/overview

GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/feeders

Confirm the overview JSON matches the new values.

Confirm feeders JSON has the correct property names and non-zero values.

Only when everything is working, respond with EXACTLY this sentence:

Done — Energy Loss overview and feeders mock data updated and verified.
