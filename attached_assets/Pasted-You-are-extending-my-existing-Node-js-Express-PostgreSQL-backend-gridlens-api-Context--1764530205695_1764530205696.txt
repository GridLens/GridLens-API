You are extending my existing Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL backend ("gridlens-api").

Context:
- I already have an Express app running with a pg Pool and a helper:

  async function query(text, params = []) {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
      const res = await client.query(text, params);
      return res.rows;
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  }

- My API already has routes like:
  - GET /health
  - GET /api/fleet/summary
  - GET /api/fleet/meters
  - GET /api/meters/:meterId/detail
  - GET /api/events

- I previously created a "contact_leads" table in my Postgres "gridlens" schema with columns:
  lead_id (PK), name, email, utility_name, role_title, phone, message, source, created_at.

Goal for this task (3.2):
Add a backend endpoint that my Webflow contact form can POST to, so every submission is stored in the contact_leads table.

High-level requirements:
1) Create a new Express POST endpoint:

   POST /api/contact

2) The endpoint should:
   - Expect JSON or URL-encoded form data from Webflow.
   - Safely read these fields from the request:

     - name          (required)
     - email         (required)
     - utility_name  (optional)
     - role_title    (optional)
     - phone         (optional)
     - message       (optional)

   - If name or email is missing, respond with HTTP 400 and a clear error JSON.
   - Insert a new row into gridlens.contact_leads using parameterized SQL to avoid SQL injection.
   - Set "source" to 'webflow-contact' by default.
   - Return a JSON success response like:

     {
       "status": "ok",
       "lead_id": <new id>,
       "message": "Contact saved successfully"
     }

3) Use the existing pg Pool + query helper. Do NOT create a second Pool.
4) Make sure the INSERT uses:

   SET search_path TO gridlens, public;

   INSERT INTO contact_leads (name, email, utility_name, role_title, phone, message, source)
   VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7)
   RETURNING lead_id;

5) Add basic error handling:
   - Log the error to console.
   - Respond with HTTP 500 and a JSON body like:
     { "status": "error", "error": "<message>" }

6) Keep CORS and JSON parsing:
   - Assume `app.use(cors())` and `app.use(express.json())` are already in place.
   - If not, show me where to add them at the top of index.js.

7) At the end, show a short example of how my Webflow form should be configured:
   - Method: POST
   - Action: https://<my-api-url>/api/contact
   - Fields mapped to: name, email, utility_name, role_title, phone, message

Important:
- Do NOT remove or rewrite my existing routes.
- Just append the new route(s) to index.js using the pattern already in the file.
- Write clean, production-quality Express code with clear comments at the top of the new section (e.g., "// Contact form endpoint").
