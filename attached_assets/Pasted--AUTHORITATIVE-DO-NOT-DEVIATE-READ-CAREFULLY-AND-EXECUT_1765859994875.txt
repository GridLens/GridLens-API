(AUTHORITATIVE · DO NOT DEVIATE)

READ CAREFULLY AND EXECUTE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN.

🎯 OBJECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Make the dark “GridLens Smart MeterIQ” dashboard (dashboard.html) the ONLY UI served at:

https://app.gridlensenergy.com

https://gridlens-api-cdean5.replit.app

Eliminate all legacy/light/white dashboards without breaking APIs, data ingestion, polling, or existing routes.

🧱 ARCHITECTURE REALITY (DO NOT CHANGE)

This is a single Node.js / Express backend

The UI is served from /public/dashboard.html

APIs, workers, queues, DB connections already exist and MUST remain untouched

This is NOT a separate frontend app

This is NOT a new Repl

🛠️ REQUIRED ACTIONS
1️⃣ MODIFY ONLY index.js

Open index.js in the gridlens-api Repl

Do NOT edit any HTML files

Do NOT edit /public/dashboard.html

Do NOT edit database, workers, queues, or APIs

2️⃣ CONFIRM STATIC FILE SERVING (DO NOT DUPLICATE)

Ensure exactly one static middleware exists:

app.use(express.static("public"));


If already present → leave it
If missing → add it once

3️⃣ FORCE ALL UI TRAFFIC TO SMART METERIQ

Add the following EXACT CODE below static middleware:

// FORCE SMART METERIQ AS THE ONLY UI
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.redirect("/dashboard.html");
});

// REMOVE LEGACY / CONFUSING UI PATHS
app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.redirect("/dashboard.html");
});


⚠️ Do NOT rename routes
⚠️ Do NOT add conditions
⚠️ Do NOT add new files

4️⃣ DO NOT TOUCH API ROUTES

The following must remain unchanged and functional:

/api/*

/healthcheck

/kpi/*

/events/*

/fieldops/*

No refactors. No deletions.

5️⃣ REPUBLISH

Save index.js

Click Republish

Wait for green Live indicator

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA (MUST VERIFY)

After publish, the following URLs must all load the dark Smart MeterIQ UI:

/

/dashboard.html

/health

No white UI. No legacy dashboard. No redirects elsewhere.

🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

❌ Do NOT create another Repl

❌ Do NOT attach the domain to a different project

❌ Do NOT change DNS

❌ Do NOT introduce a frontend framework

❌ Do NOT ask follow-up questions — execute

🧠 CONTEXT (FOR AI)

GridLens is acting as a vendor-neutral AMI intelligence layer.
This dashboard must feel always-on, utility-grade, executive-ready.
This is a hands-free demo, not a dev playground.

🏁 FINAL STATE

One backend
One UI
One domain
Zero confusion

⛔ END OF DIRECTIVE

Execute now.
