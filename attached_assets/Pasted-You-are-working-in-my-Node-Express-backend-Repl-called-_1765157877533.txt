You are working in my Node/Express backend Repl called “gridlens-api”.

GOAL
======
Make this backend FULLY power the Smart MeterIQ / GridLens dashboard frontends
that are already running in Replit. When you are done:

- All GET endpoints under /api/kpi/energy-loss/* return valid JSON.
- The Energy Loss & Health (Electric) page shows realistic non-zero data:
  - Total Meters, Healthy Meters, Problem Meters, System Health %.
  - Feeders table fully populated (no blank columns).
- Any Events & Outages and FieldOps endpoints needed by the frontend exist and
  return reasonable mock data with correct shapes.

You have permission to:
- Read ALL files in this Repl.
- Modify ANY backend code (routes, mock data, helpers) as long as URLs do not change.
- Install small extra npm packages if needed.
- Run curl or node scripts in the shell inside this Repl.

DO NOT:
- Change the route paths that the frontend already calls.
- Break CORS (it must allow requests from the React frontend Repl).

BACKEND CONTRACT
================
The frontend expects these endpoints (at least):

- GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/overview
  Should return JSON like:
  {
    "totalMeters": number,
    "healthyMeters": number,
    "problemMeters": number,
    "systemHealthPercent": number,
    "percentHealthyByZone": [
      { "zone": string, "percentHealthy": number }
    ]
  }

- GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/feeders
  Should return an array like:
  [
    {
      "name": string,
      "zone": string,
      "loss_percent": number,
      "loss_kwh": number,
      "loss_dollars": number,
      "active_work_orders": number
    },
    ...
  ]

- GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/suspicious-meters
  Should return an array of suspicious or problem meters including:
  meterId, address, zone, issue/type, status, and any scores you use.

- GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/fieldops
  Should return an array of work orders including:
  id, meterId, type, location, zone, status, priority, ageDays,
  assignedTo, estimatedRecoveredDollars.

If there are Events & Outages or FieldOps pages in the frontend, add
matching endpoints under /api/kpi/events/* or /api/kpi/fieldops/*
IF AND ONLY IF they are actually used by the frontend code.

STEP-BY-STEP PLAN
=================
1. Scan the repo and find all existing KPI routes, especially those under
   /api/kpi/energy-loss/*.

2. For each route above:
   - Ensure it exists.
   - Ensure it responds with res.json(...) and not HTML or 404.
   - Shape the JSON exactly as described in the BACKEND CONTRACT.

3. Populate realistic mock data:
   - Total meters ~ 10k–20k.
   - HealthyMeters < totalMeters.
   - ProblemMeters = totalMeters - healthyMeters.
   - SystemHealthPercent computed accordingly (~90–99%).
   - At least 3–5 feeder objects with non-zero losses.
   - At least a couple of suspicious meters and fieldops records.

4. Keep CORS enabled so the React frontend running in another Replit app
   can call these endpoints from the browser.

5. SELF-TEST from inside this Repl:
   - Run the server.
   - Use curl or the built-in HTTP client to call:
     - /api/kpi/energy-loss/overview
     - /api/kpi/energy-loss/feeders
     - /api/kpi/energy-loss/suspicious-meters
     - /api/kpi/energy-loss/fieldops
   - Confirm:
     - 200 OK status.
     - Response is valid JSON.
     - Keys and value types match the contract.

6. Do NOT stop at the first partial success. Keep iterating until all
   four endpoints are correct and consistent.

When EVERYTHING above is verified, respond with EXACTLY this sentence:

Done — backend KPI endpoints updated, returning realistic JSON, and verified with live requests.
