You are editing my Node/Express backend. I need you to wire existing Postgres KPI VIEWS into my API.

GOAL:
Expose executive-ready endpoints that read from these views (already created in Azure Postgres):
- public.v_kpi_electric_overview_daily
- public.v_kpi_electric_feeder_loss_daily (if present; if not present, return a helpful error message)

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Update index.js to mount a router at:
   /api/kpi/energy-loss

2) Create a new router file at:
   routes/kpiEnergyLoss.js

3) Use pg Pool (DATABASE_URL from env). If Pool already exists, reuse it. Do NOT hardcode credentials.
4) Tenant logic:
   - Determine tenantId from (in order):
     a) req.header('x-tenant-id')
     b) req.query.tenantId
     c) default 'DEMO_TENANT'
   - Always filter queries by tenant_id when the view has tenant_id column.
5) Endpoints:
   GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/overview
   - Query:
     SELECT day, total_loss_kwh, loss_percent_pct, top_loss_feeders
     FROM v_kpi_electric_overview_daily
     WHERE tenant_id = $1
     ORDER BY day DESC
     LIMIT 1;
   - Return JSON exactly:
     {
       "totalLossKWh": <number>,
       "lossPercent": <number>,
       "topLossFeeders": <array>,
       "lastUpdated": <ISO string>
     }
     - lastUpdated should be day as ISO string, or new Date().toISOString() fallback.

   GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/feeders
   - Query:
     SELECT feeder, loss_percent
     FROM v_kpi_electric_feeder_loss_daily
     WHERE tenant_id = $1
     ORDER BY loss_percent DESC
     LIMIT 10;
   - Return JSON array exactly:
     [ { "feeder": "...", "lossPercent": <number> }, ... ]

6) Error handling:
   - If a view is missing, return 500 with:
     { "error": "KPI view missing", "details": "<postgres message>" }
   - Always log the error server-side.

7) After implementing, add quick local sanity logs or comments showing example curl commands.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Convert numeric strings to numbers (parseFloat) before returning.
- top_loss_feeders is jsonb; ensure it returns as an array (if null, return []).
- Keep responses stable and dashboard-friendly.

Now implement:
- index.js changes
- routes/kpiEnergyLoss.js creation
- any minimal required imports
- do not delete existing routes
