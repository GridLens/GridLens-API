You are helping me extend an existing Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL backend called "gridlens-api".

Context:
- The app is already set up with Express and the "pg" Pool.
- It connects to my Azure PostgreSQL using process.env.DATABASE_URL.
- We are already using a helper like:

  async function query(text, params = []) {
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
      const res = await client.query(text, params);
      return res.rows;
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  }

- We are using the "gridlens" schema for my tables (meters, meter_health_daily, etc.). We often run: `SET search_path TO gridlens, public;` before SELECT/INSERT.

Goal for this task (3.1):
Create a SQL definition for a new table called "contact_leads" in the "gridlens" schema, and show me how to run it safely.

Requirements:
1) The table name must be: gridlens.contact_leads
2) Columns:
   - lead_id        BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY
   - name           TEXT NOT NULL
   - email          TEXT NOT NULL
   - utility_name   TEXT            -- e.g. "Holly Springs Utility Department"
   - role_title     TEXT            -- e.g. "GM", "Engineering Manager"
   - phone          TEXT
   - message        TEXT
   - source         TEXT DEFAULT 'webflow-contact'  -- where the lead came from
   - created_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
3) The SQL must be idempotent (use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS) so I can run it multiple times without errors.
4) It should explicitly set the search path to "gridlens, public" so the table is created in the correct schema.

Deliverables:
A) A single SQL script I can run in pgAdmin / Query Tool, similar to:

   SET search_path TO gridlens, public;

   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS contact_leads (
     ...
   );

B) Then, show me a short Node.js helper function (optional) that I can call like:
   await query("INSERT INTO contact_leads ...", [...]);

Important:
- DO NOT rewrite or replace my entire index.js file.
- Just give me the SQL script and, optionally, a short code snippet that uses my existing "query" helper.
