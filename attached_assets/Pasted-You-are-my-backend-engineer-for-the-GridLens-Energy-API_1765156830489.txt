You are my backend engineer for the GridLens Energy API.

This Repl is the Node/Express backend that serves KPI endpoints for Smart MeterIQ.

GOAL
-----
Update the mock data for the **electric Energy Loss & Health** KPIs so the frontend React page at
`/energy-loss-health` shows realistic values:

- Not all meters are "problem" meters.
- The summary tiles show a healthy system but with meaningful loss.
- The feeders table shows names and dollar impact, not blank cells.

FILES TO EDIT
-------------
Work ONLY in `index.js` (or whichever main server file defines the routes).
DO NOT change the shape of the Express app or ports.

WHAT THE FRONTEND EXPECTS
-------------------------
1) Overview endpoint:
   Route: GET `/api/kpi/energy-loss/overview`

   Return JSON with at least these fields:

   ```js
   {
     totalMeters: number,          // e.g. 12000
     healthyMeters: number,       // e.g. 11250
     problemMeters: number,       // e.g. 750
     systemHealthPercent: number, // e.g. 93.8

     percentHealthyByZone: [
       { zone: 'Zone 1', percentHealthy: 92 },
       { zone: 'Zone 2', percentHealthy: 94 },
       { zone: 'Zone 3', percentHealthy: 95 }
     ]
   }
Make these values:

totalMeters: 12000

healthyMeters: 11250

problemMeters: 750

systemHealthPercent: 93.8

3–4 realistic zones in percentHealthyByZone.

Feeders endpoint:
Route: GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/feeders

Return an array of feeder objects. Each feeder object should use
property names that the React table understands:

js
Copy code
{
  name: string,              // feeder name or code
  loss_percent: number,      // loss percentage (e.g. 4.2)
  loss_kwh: number,          // monthly loss kWh (e.g. 12500)
  loss_dollars: number,      // monthly loss dollars (e.g. 18500)
  active_work_orders: number // count of active WOs
}
Example array (you can tune the exact numbers but keep them realistic):

js
Copy code
[
  {
    name: 'Feeder 101',
    zone: 'Zone 1',
    loss_percent: 4.2,
    loss_kwh: 12500,
    loss_dollars: 18750,
    active_work_orders: 2
  },
  {
    name: 'Feeder 202',
    zone: 'Zone 2',
    loss_percent: 3.1,
    loss_kwh: 9800,
    loss_dollars: 14700,
    active_work_orders: 1
  },
  {
    name: 'Feeder 303',
    zone: 'Zone 3',
    loss_percent: 2.6,
    loss_kwh: 7600,
    loss_dollars: 11400,
    active_work_orders: 0
  },
  {
    name: 'Feeder 404',
    zone: 'Zone 3',
    loss_percent: 5.0,
    loss_kwh: 15000,
    loss_dollars: 22500,
    active_work_orders: 3
  }
]
IMPORTANT: Use exactly these property names:

name

loss_percent

loss_kwh

loss_dollars

active_work_orders
(and optional zone)

The React table already knows how to read any of:

name || feeder || feeder_name

lossPct || loss_percent

lossKwh || loss_kwh

lossDollars || loss_dollars

activeWo || active_work_orders

For safety, choose the snake_case versions above.

Suspicious meters endpoint:
Route: GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/suspicious-meters

Keep the existing structure, but make sure:

meterId, address, zone, status, and riskScore fields are present

values look consistent with the feeders (same zones, realistic IDs).

FieldOps endpoint:
Route: GET /api/kpi/energy-loss/fieldops

Keep the structure you already have, but ensure:

meterId matches IDs used in suspicious-meters/feeders where possible,

zone matches the same zones as above,

status, priority, and estimatedRecoveredDollars have realistic values.

STEPS
Find the existing handlers for:

/api/kpi/energy-loss/overview

/api/kpi/energy-loss/feeders

/api/kpi/energy-loss/suspicious-meters

/api/kpi/energy-loss/fieldops

Replace ONLY the mock data objects/arrays in those handlers with
the new realistic values/shape described above.

Do NOT change the route paths or HTTP methods.

After editing, run a quick self-test inside the Repl:

Call each endpoint with curl or the built-in HTTP client and
confirm they return JSON with the updated fields.

When everything is done and the server is running without errors,
respond only with:
“Energy Loss KPI endpoints updated with realistic mock data and matching field names.”
