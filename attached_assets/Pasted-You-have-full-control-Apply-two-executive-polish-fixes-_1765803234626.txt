You have full control. Apply two executive-polish fixes without breaking anything.

RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Do NOT remove, rename, or change meaning of any existing JSON keys.
- All current consumers must keep working.
- Only ADD fields or filter optional lists in a backwards-compatible way.

FIX #1 — Add an executive-friendly label (talk-track support)
In GET /api/ami/kpi/quickcheck response:
- Keep existing "lossStats" object unchanged.
- ADD a new object called "executiveSummary" with friendly labels.

Add:
executiveSummary: {
  "avgIntervalKwhProxy": <number>,
  "avgIntervalKwhProxyLabel": "Average interval kWh (proxy)",
  "readSuccessRatePct": <number>,
  "lowVoltageReadsPct": <number>,
  "topExceptionFeeder": { feederId, exceptionScore }
}

Mapping:
- avgIntervalKwhProxy = lossStats.avg_loss (as numeric)
- readSuccessRatePct = reportingSummary.readSuccessRatePct
- lowVoltageReadsPct = voltageCompliance.lowVoltageReadsPct
- topExceptionFeeder = first item in topExceptionFeeders (if any)

This lets the presenter say “Average interval kWh (proxy)” instead of “loss”.

FIX #2 — Make topExceptionFeeders cleaner (remove trailing zeros)
Currently topExceptionFeeders returns many feeders with exceptionScore=0.
Change behavior:
- Keep existing "topExceptionFeeders" key.
- But filter out any rows where exceptionScore <= 0.
- If everything is zero, return an empty array (do not fabricate data).
- Preserve ordering by exceptionScore DESC and still limit to top 10.

OPTIONAL (nice):
Also add "topExceptionFeedersAll" if you want to preserve the unfiltered list internally, but it is not required. If you add it, keep the same schema as before.

PROOF (must run and paste outputs):
1) Run quickcheck and show that:
- lossStats still exists (unchanged)
- executiveSummary exists with avgIntervalKwhProxyLabel
- topExceptionFeeders no longer includes zero-score feeders
2) Confirm response remains valid JSON.

Proceed now and do not stop until proof is shown with curl output.
