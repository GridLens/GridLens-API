REPLIT AI — ENTERPRISE RECOVERY: GitHub Actions failing because infra/envs/demo missing in GitHub.

Latest error in GitHub Actions:
An error occurred trying to start process '/usr/bin/bash' with working directory
'/home/runner/work/GridLens-API/GridLens-API/infra/envs/demo'. No such file or directory

FACTS:
- Repo: https://github.com/GridLens/GridLens-API.git
- Branch: main
- Workflow now references working-directory: infra/envs/demo (correct).
- The problem is infra/ does NOT exist in GitHub main.
- Local cleanup removed infra/ because it was untracked at the time.

GOAL:
Restore infra/ from authoritative source and push it to GitHub so Actions can find infra/envs/demo.

HARD RULES:
1) Do NOT change Terraform code inside infra/.
2) Do NOT change directory structure.
3) Do NOT delete app code.
4) Do NOT paste secrets.
5) Show command outputs for every checkpoint.

TASKS (DO IN ORDER):

A) Confirm current state (show outputs):
   pwd
   git status
   git remote -v
   ls -la infra || true
   ls -la .github/workflows || true

B) Recover infra/ using the BEST available source in this order:

   SOURCE 1: gitsafe-backup (preferred)
   1) Fetch all backup refs:
      git fetch gitsafe-backup --prune

   2) Find which backup branch contains infra/envs/demo/main.tf:
      for b in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/remotes/gitsafe-backup/); do
        git ls-tree -r --name-only "$b" | grep -q '^infra/envs/demo/main.tf$' && echo "FOUND in $b";
      done

   3) If FOUND, restore ONLY infra/ from that exact branch:
      git checkout main
      git checkout <FOUND_BRANCH> -- infra

   SOURCE 2: Replit filesystem (if SOURCE 1 fails)
   If gitsafe-backup does not contain infra/, search local filesystem:
      find . -maxdepth 3 -type d -name infra -print
      find / -maxdepth 4 -type d -name infra 2>/dev/null | head
   If infra exists elsewhere in this workspace, copy it into repo root as ./infra (preserving structure).

C) Validate recovered infra (must show outputs):
   ls -la infra
   ls -la infra/envs
   ls -la infra/envs/demo
   test -f infra/envs/demo/main.tf && echo "OK: demo main.tf exists" || echo "FAIL: missing demo main.tf"

D) Push infra to GitHub in an enterprise-safe way:
   1) Create a dedicated branch:
      git checkout -b add-terraform-infra

   2) Stage ONLY infra/ (no other changes):
      git add infra/
      git status

   3) Commit:
      git commit -m "Add Terraform infra (envs + modules)"

   4) Push branch:
      git push -u origin add-terraform-infra

E) Create PR instructions (since you can’t merge yourself):
   Provide exact GitHub UI steps to open PR:
   base=main, compare=add-terraform-infra, then merge.

F) Post-merge verification checklist:
   - Confirm infra/envs/demo exists in GitHub
   - Re-run Actions → deploy-demo → action=plan
   - Expected: no more "No such file or directory" for infra/envs/demo

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Sectioned output A-F
- Include all command outputs
- End with: "Infra restored and pushed; after PR merge, Actions will find infra/envs/demo."
